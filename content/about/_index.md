Shu Guo bridges the worlds of building practice, historical research, and 
economic systems. As a registered Building Designer and Builder with 
twenty years of experience, he has a deep understanding of the Australian 
housing industry's realities.

His career traces the evolution of construction innovation itself. From 
leading pioneering 3D-printing projects to his current role as Co-founder 
and Chief Design Officer at Signex, a prefabricated housing provider, he 
has been instrumental in bringing next-generation MMC to market.

This practical innovation is guided by a unique intellectual pursuit: 
years of deep research into classical Chinese architecture, gardens, and 
historical building systems like the Yingzao Fashi. He deciphers how 
ancient, systemized wisdom can inform modern challenges. As a graduate in 
economics, his work is particularly focused on the systemic forces and 
market dynamics that shape the built environment—a perspective that 
defines his approach to architecture & system.
