Shu Guo is a Registered Building Designer and Builder with 20 years of experience in the 
Australian housing industry. His career spans the evolution of construction innovation, 
from leading early 3D-printing projects to his current role as Co-founder and Chief 
Design Officer at Signex, a prefabricated housing provider.  

Alongside his practice, he conducts research into classical Chinese architecture, 
gardens, and building systems. His work focuses on how historical frameworks — such as 
those codified in the *Yingzao Fashi* (China's 1103 National Building Code) — can address 
contemporary challenges in housing delivery. With an academic background in economics, 
his analysis centers on the systemic and economic forces that shape the built 
environment.
